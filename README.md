# SudokuValidation
This is a sudoku checker function that uses multiple shorter functions to check to see if a given sudoku grid filled is 100% correct.

I made this in order to complete an admission assement course. I also did this so i can learn the basics of java script.

The code consists of 5 functions ; 4 of the functions are called into the other function so that the actual purpose of this code works.

First time coding in java script.
